# Learn.Build Web Dev Cohort - To-Do List App with React

This repository is a reflection of my journey in the `learn.build` Web Dev Cohort. Feel free to explore the code and delve into the world of React-driven web applications. Happy coding! ðŸš€

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yusra05/LearnBuild_ToDoListApp.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\example\LearnBuild_ToDoListApp

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
  

Here's a breakdown of what we accomplished each week in our course:

## Week 1: Introduction to React and Setting Up the Development Environment
- **Understanding React Basics:** Introduced to React's component-based architecture.
- **Environment Setup:** Configured the development environment with Node.js, npm, and create-react-app.
- **First Component:** Created and integrated the first React component into the app.

## Week 2: Building the To-Do List UI
- **Designing UI:** Crafted the user interface for the to-do list app using React components and JSX.
- **Task Components:** Developed components for adding, displaying, and deleting tasks.
- **Styling:** Applied CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

## Week 3: Managing State and Adding Functionality
- **State and Props:** Explored React state and props for managing data and inter-component communication.
- **State Management:** Implemented state management techniques to handle to-do list data.
- **Functionality:** Added features for task addition, editing, completion, and deletion.

## Week 4: Advanced Features and Deployment
- **Task Filtering:** Implemented advanced features such as task filtering (completed, active, all).
- **Persistence:** Incorporated local storage to persist tasks across sessions.
- **Deployment:** Deployed the to-do list app using platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
